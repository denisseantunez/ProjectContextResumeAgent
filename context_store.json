    "summary": "1. What the developer was working on:\nThe developer was focused on implementing the database layer for the project retsia. This likely involves setting up the schema, connection logic, and possibly writing queries or integration code.\n\n2. Why (goal / feature / bug):\nThe goal was to enable persistent data management within retsia, which is crucial for core functionality or feature support. The database implementation was a foundational step after refactoring and updating the project to Python 3.13.\n\n3. What the next concrete step should be:\nThe next step should be to write and run tests on the database implementation to verify data operations behave correctly. This includes connection tests, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and error handling.\n\n4. A 2-minute re-entry task:\nReview the database implementation commit (c8ea673). Scan through the database connection and schema setup code to reacquaint yourself with the design choices and data flow before proceeding with tests or integration.",
