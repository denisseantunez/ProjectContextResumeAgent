Then, integrate these improvements or findings into the example notebooks for clarity and reproducibility.\n\n4. A 2-minute re-entry task:\nOpen the `examples/prueba.ipynb` notebook, rerun the training cells for the breastmnist network, and check the current model\u2019s performance metrics and any training logs or plots to refresh understanding of the setup and results.",

This quick check will guide the immediate next steps and confirm the stability of the recent work.",

Two-minute re-entry task: Build the project and run the game to identify any immediate runtime errors or crashes. Then, perform a basic check by starting a new game and observing if the board initializes and updates properly after a few turns.

The developer was working on synchronization functionality with a PC, as indicated by the commit \"sincronizavinizacion con PC.\" The changes span multiple files, including a UI construction C# script and project ignore settings.

The goal was likely to improve or fix synchronization between the Juego_Castor project and a PC environment, potentially to get the UI or data syncing properly, as suggested by edits in LibroConstruccionUI.cs and synchronization-related commits. The vague commit messages imply ongoing experimentation or debugging.\n\n3. Next concrete step: Clarify and document the synchronization functionality. Review the synchronization code and UI to ensure that syncing works reliably. Implement or test any missing features to confirm the UI connects correctly with the PC sync logic.\n\n4. 2-minute re-entry task: Open the LibroConstruccionUI.cs file and locate the sections related to synchronization. Add brief comments explaining the purpose of key methods or blocks involved in syncing. Then, run the project locally and verify if the synchronization feature triggers as expected when interacting with the UI. This helps regain context quickly and confirms current functionality.",

Additionally, there were updates to the audio mixer system and game mode switching with music filtering.\n\n2. Why (goal / feature / bug):\nThe goal was to expand the game's content by introducing new constructs and implement new features like the highway system to enhance gameplay. Audio improvements aimed for a better sound experience in different game modes. The bugs in the highway implementation indicate that this feature is not fully stable yet.\n\n3. What the next concrete step should be:\nFocus on identifying and fixing the bugs in the highway implementation to make the feature stable and playable. This may involve debugging the highway code and testing its integration with other systems such as movement, animations, and audio transitions.\n\n4. A 2-minute re-entry task:\nLoad the project and open the highway-related scripts and prefabs that were recently changed (look for \"Highway\" in construct prefabs and scripts). Review the code sections where the new highway feature is implemented, and run the game to test the highway behavior.
